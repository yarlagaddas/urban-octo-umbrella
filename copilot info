Absolutely 👍 — let’s first break down what the email instructions actually said, in simple, structured points.

The email titled “Copilot Insights: Unlock the Full Potential of GitHub Copilot with Custom Instructions” is basically a 6-step framework from GitHub/BofA’s DevEx team on how to train Copilot to generate code that truly fits your project — not just generic snippets.

Here’s what each section means 👇

⸻

🧭 1. Comments Aren’t Just for Devs Anymore

Copilot reads your comments to understand why you’re doing something — not just what.

Meaning:
When you add meaningful comments explaining intent, Copilot will produce better and more context-aware code.
Instead of writing:
// fetch user data
You can write:
// fetch user profile details for dashboard display with fallback to cached response

Why this matters:
Copilot learns your reasoning and domain — so suggestions match your logic rather than being generic.

Pro Tip (from email):
Write comments like you’re explaining code to a new team member. Copilot will interpret them the same way.

⸻

🧱 2. Start with a Project Overview

Give Copilot the “big picture.”

Meaning:
You should tell Copilot what your project is about, who it serves, and what its key modules are — just like onboarding a new dev.

Why this matters:
If Copilot understands your project’s purpose (e.g., “Angular-based internal governance UI for workflow automation”), it generates more relevant code.

Pro Tip:
Add this overview in a file called:
.github/copilot-instructions.md

That file lives in your repo root and is automatically read by Copilot in every chat.

⸻

⚙️ 3. Define Your Tech Stack

Tell Copilot which frameworks, tools, and libraries you use.

Meaning:
List all the technologies (Angular, TypeScript, Jest, Kendo, Material, etc.) — because Copilot tailors code based on that.

Why this matters:
Without this, Copilot may assume React, Node, or vanilla JS — leading to wrong syntax or imports.

Pro Tip:
Document your stack inside copilot-instructions.md. Example from email:

Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Frontend: React with TypeScript
Testing: Jest, Cypress

🧩 4. Outline Coding Guidelines

Define your rules for formatting, naming, testing, and conventions.

Meaning:
Codify your style — how to name variables, structure components, handle APIs, etc.
This helps Copilot follow your conventions instead of random defaults.

Why this matters:
Copilot learns from your standards. You save time reformatting or rewriting AI-generated code.

Pro Tip:
If you have specific rules per area (e.g., API naming, test writing), create small modular .md files like:

.github/instructions/angular-components.md
.github/instructions/testing.md

🗂 5. Map Your Project Structure

Tell Copilot how your repo is organized.

Meaning:
Document the directory layout (e.g., where components, services, and models live).

Why this matters:
Copilot can recommend correct import paths and know where new files belong.

Example:
src/
  app/
    core/
    shared/
    features/
  assets/
  environments/

Pro Tip:
Keep relevant files open while coding — Copilot uses your open file context to improve accuracy.

⸻

🔁 6. Create Reusable Prompts for Your Team

Build prompt templates that your whole team can reuse.

Meaning:
Instead of typing the same instructions every time, store common prompts in:

.github/prompts/

Example prompt file:

# .github/prompts/code-review.prompt.md
Review this Angular PR.
Check for OnPush, signals, strict typing, accessibility, and test coverage.

Why this matters:
Ensures consistency — every dev gets the same style and review focus.

Pro Tip:
Prompts can also link to your .github/instructions files, so they reuse your team’s specific patterns (e.g., Angular Material setup, REST API best practices).

⸻

💡 BONUS TIP: “Let Copilot Help You”

You can even ask Copilot to write your first .github/copilot-instructions.md file for you — and then refine it.

So Copilot can bootstrap your documentation and improve with each iteration.

So in short:
The email teaches you how to make Copilot “understand your project like a teammate.”
It’s not just about using Copilot in VSCode — it’s about training it through structured markdown files.

⸻

Would you like me to now explain how to apply these six steps specifically to your Angular 19 SWFT Governance UI project, using your package.json setup as reference (so you can discuss that clearly in your meeting)?

###############
Can you elaborate more again with use case?

Excellent — let’s walk through each of the six GitHub Copilot custom instruction points again, but this time with concrete real-world examples directly applied to your Angular 19 SWFT Governance UI project.

⸻

🧠 1. Comments Aren’t Just for Devs Anymore

What it means

Copilot reads your comments as instructions, not just notes.
If you write clear comments about your intent, Copilot generates code that matches your logic and business purpose.

SWFT Governance UI Example

Imagine you’re creating a Kendo grid for displaying workflow approvals.
❌ Generic comment:
// show approval list

✅ Effective comment (Copilot reads context):
// Display governance approval requests with pagination and sorting using Kendo Grid
// Fetch data from swft-business-rules-service API

Copilot will now:
	•	Use Kendo Grid (instead of HTML table)
	•	Generate correct Angular Material/Kendo imports
	•	Use async pipe or signals for data flow
	•	Call SWFT API service

⸻

🧭 2. Start with a Project Overview

What it means

You tell Copilot the big picture — what the app does, who uses it, and why it exists.

SWFT Governance UI Example

In your .github/copilot-instructions.md:
# Project Overview
SWFT Governance UI is an Angular 19 web application for managing business approval workflows.
It integrates with internal SWFT microservices (ngx-admin, data-table, business-rules-service)
to display data grids, process approval actions, and manage configurations.
The UI is built using Angular Material and Kendo UI components.

Now Copilot will “think” in the context of:
	•	Angular 19 syntax
	•	Your internal SWFT component library
	•	UI built around governance workflows

So if you ask:

“Generate a component for approval status tracking”

Copilot will not make a generic React app — it’ll create an Angular component consistent with your stack.

⚙️ 3. Define Your Tech Stack

What it means

Explicitly list your frameworks and dependencies, so Copilot doesn’t guess.

SWFT Governance UI Example

From your package.json, document in markdown:
# Tech Stack
- Angular 19.2.2
- TypeScript 5.4+
- Angular Material 19.2.3
- Kendo UI for Angular 18.5.0
- Jest (unit testing)
- ESLint + Prettier (linting/formatting)
- Cypress (E2E tests)
- SWFT internal libraries:
  - swft-ngx-admin
  - swft-ngx-app-properties-service
  - swft-business-rules-service
  - swft-ngx-data-table

✅ Why this matters
When you later type:

“create a modal using Material”

Copilot now knows it must import from:

import { MatDialog } from '@angular/material/dialog';

instead of Bootstrap or React equivalents.

⸻

🧩 4. Outline Coding Guidelines

What it means

Define how your team writes Angular code — naming, testing, formatting, component patterns, etc.

SWFT Governance UI Example

# Coding Guidelines
- Use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for all components.
- Prefer `standalone: true` components.
- Organize features under `/src/app/features/<feature-name>`.
- Use `signal()` for state where possible; avoid manual subscriptions.
- Services must be `providedIn: 'root'`.
- Use ESLint and Prettier rules from project setup.
- SCSS follows BEM naming: `.feature__element--modifier`.
- Follow REST API naming conventions: `/api/v1/governance/requests`.
- Write one Jest test per component and service.

✅ Why this matters
Now Copilot will generate:

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'swft-approval-list',
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
  ...
})

instead of skipping OnPush or old module-based syntax.

⸻

🗂 5. Map Your Project Structure

What it means

Show Copilot where files live — so it can create correct imports and relative paths.

SWFT Governance UI Example

# Project Structure
src/
  app/
    core/             # services, interceptors
    shared/           # reusable components (e.g., table, modal)
    features/
      approvals/      # feature module for approval workflows
      rules/          # business rules configuration
    assets/
    environments/

✅ Why this matters
When you ask Copilot:

“create a service for rule validation”

it will:
	•	Place it under src/app/core/services/
	•	Auto-import correct paths like:

import { RulesService } from '@swft/swft-business-rules-service';

🔁 6. Create Reusable Prompts for Your Team

What it means

You can save common “Copilot instructions” (prompts) into reusable .md files — so all devs can use the same templates.

SWFT Governance UI Example

In .github/prompts/:

✅ Example 1: component.prompt.md
Generate an Angular 19 standalone component with OnPush detection and SCSS.
Include a Kendo UI Grid using async pipe.
Component name: {componentName}
Data source: {apiService}
Add Jest test with 80% coverage.

✅ Example 2: service.prompt.md
Create an Angular service named {serviceName}.
Use HttpClient from '@angular/common/http' and connect to {API_URL}.
Include retry logic, error handling, and logging.
Generate a Jest test using HttpTestingController.

✅ Example 3: code-review.prompt.md
Review this Angular PR for:
- Standalone component usage
- OnPush detection
- Signal or RxJS cleanup
- TypeScript strict typing
- Test coverage and lint compliance

✅ Why this matters
Now, every team member can call these prompts from Copilot Chat directly:
/copilot prompt: .github/prompts/component.prompt.md

— and everyone gets consistent results.

⸻

💡 BONUS TIP: “Let Copilot Help You”

You can even type in Copilot Chat:

“Generate a .github/copilot-instructions.md file for this Angular project”

It will draft it for you based on your open files and dependencies — you then refine it with the rules above.
